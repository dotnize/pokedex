# Pokedex

A simple Pokedex app using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for the KreiosLabs assessment.

Built with SvelteKit from my own simple [template](https://github.com/dotnize/svelte-playground) which is based on the official `create-svelte` TypeScript template, but with Tailwind CSS and my own Prettier & other formatting configurations.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:dotnize/pokedex.git
   ```
   or via HTTPS:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dotnize/pokedex.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install # or pnpm install
   ```
3. Run the development server
   ```sh
   npm run dev # or pnpm dev
   ```

### Building for production

```sh
npm run build

# preview the production build
npm run preview
```

This project can also be deployed easily to Vercel or Netlify with no additional configuration.
